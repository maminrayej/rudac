# rudac

Rudac is a **Ru**st **D**ata structure and **A**lgorithm **C**rate.
It aims to be a comprehensive crate of usefull data structure and algorithms.

It is still an ongoing project.

Data structures:
* Queue:
    - Circular Queue / Circular Buffer
* Heap:
    - Binomial Heap
    - Fibonacci Heap
    - Min-Max Heap
* Tree:
    - Binomial Tree
    - AVL Tree
    - Red-Black Tree
    - Interval Tree
* Utils:
    - Interval (Open, closed and unbounded intervals)

Algorithms:
* Find:
    - kth smallest item(including min, max, median)
* Search:
    - Binary Search
    - Exponential Search
    - Fibonacci Search
    - Linear Search
* Sort:
    - Merge Sort
    - Quick Sort
* Transformation:
    - Partition around a pivot
